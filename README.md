I am Back-End Software Developer..
I develop projects since my childhood (around 2011/12). Algoritmization, and creating approaches to solve problems was my driving force that got me into making software development inseparable part of my life.

Nowadays, I focus on Back-End Software Development, I have rather rich experiences in Go language, but also Python, C/C++, C# are languages I often utilize.

I develop projects for me and people around, touch with electronic world and cryptocurrencies are also occuring theme of my bastler and professional life.

I am crazy aviation geek with my little pet project of a home simulator for Boeing 737NG.
