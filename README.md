I am Back-End Software Developer.

Algoritmization, reverse-engineering, and creating approaches to solve problems is my most favourite part of software development.

Studying at VÅ B Technical University of Ostrava, Computer Science.

I am crazy aviation geek with my little pet project of a home simulator for Boeing 737NG.
